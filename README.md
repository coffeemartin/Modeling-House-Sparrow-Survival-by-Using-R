# House Sparrow Survival Prediction Using a Logistic Binary Regression
This report is to investigate the relationship between house sparrow survival rate and their morphological
measurements. <br>
<br>
Data on 163 house sparrow is collected by Anatomical Laboratory of Brown University after
an uncommonly severe winter storm.<br>
<br>
A logistic binary regression was fitted to the data. The model indicates
that overall, sparrows with shorter total length and lighter body weight, but longer sternum and humerus
have a higher chance of survival. In addition being male also increases the chance of survival.
